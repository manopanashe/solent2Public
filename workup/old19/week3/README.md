# Week 3 exercises

This week we will begin to look at a multi module maven project which will teach you about implementing a simple credit card application.
As previously, you should copy this project into your myPracticeCourseWork folder before making any changes.

The bankcard-parent project will build from week to week into a fully fledged application.

Before looking at the overall project, we will begin by looking at the use cases in card-uml

[week3/bankcard-parent/card-uml](../week3/bankcard-parent/card-uml)

once you have understood the use cases you can proceed to do the exercises in card-main

[week3/bankcard-parent/card-validator](../week3/bankcard-parent/card-validator)
