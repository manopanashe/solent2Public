# MOCK TIME CONSTRAINED ASSESSMENT 

This folder contains an answer to the Mock TCA1

## INSTRUCTIONS

This exercise tests your ability to design within the constraints of an existing project and set of design patterns. 

You should read ALL of the instructions before you begin.

You will have 2 hours to complete this exercise. 

It is unlikely that you will get all of the tasks done so prioritise your work to maximise your marks.

### setup

Merge my upstream repo with yours and copy this project folder mock-tca1 into your my practice coursework folder.

Intialise maven and javac on the class path of your project as previously shown in class.

Build the hotellock-parent project using mvn clean install

Push the project up to your repo 

```
git add --all
git commit -m 'YOUR NAME start of TCA TODAYS DATE'
```

Read the hotellock-parent README.MD file for further instructions on what to do.

### Finishing up

At the end of the allocated time you will be asked to stop work.

At that point, check your latest work into your repository using the following message

```
git add --all
git commit -m 'YOUR NAME end of TCA TODAYS DATE'
```

You will now tag your commit
```
git tag -a TCA1 -m 'YOUR NAME end of TCA TODAYS DATE'
git push origin --tags
```

Your TCA work is now tagged in your own repository

In an examined TCA exercise, we would also ask you to zip your project and submit it to sol.
