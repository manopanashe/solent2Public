# Week 10 Starting your project using an archetype
This week we will look at how you can go about creating your project.

To help we have created an example project which illustrates all of the essential features which we have covered in class.

More usefully we have also created a maven archetype which will generate a skeleton project for you to use as a starting point for your project.

Both of these projects can be found here:
